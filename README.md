# Warehouse Object Sorter Simulation

This project simulates an intelligent warehouse object sorting workflow using Python and OpenCV.

## What it does
- Loads images of objects
- Detects objects using computer vision
- Classifies objects using rule-based logic
- Assigns objects to bins (A / B / C)
- Saves results as annotated images and a CSV file

## Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Git & GitHub

## Folder Structure
- images/ → input images
- outputs/ → annotated images and CSV results
- main.py → main program

## Output
- Green bounding box around detected object
- Text label showing object color and bin
- CSV file with object_id, color, bin, and area
